## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

This web application was built with React as an as an adaptation of [brittanychiang.com](https://brittanychiang.com) made with Gatsby.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.
